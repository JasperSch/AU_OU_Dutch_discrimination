This code was developped for the course Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis at KU Leuven.
All words were downloaded from the publicly available website: woorden.org.
(You can however use your own lists of words to perform the same kind of analysis.)
Put all 3 files within the same folder and set the working directory accordingly. You can as well specify the full path to the csv files.

If in need for a Dutch translation of parts of the code, feel free to contact me.

The code should be quite adaptable to include/exclude data parsing functions.
There is improvement possible regarding the data analysis. If you should be able to get better results, I would be very interested.
